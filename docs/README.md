# END OF LIFE
The development of the bot is being moved to end of life starting Jan 1, 2025.
I have made the decission to due to me not having as much time to maintain it and I want to use the time that I do have to work on new projects.

What can you expect from this:
* The bot will not get any new features.
* Security fixes will be provided if there are major security flaws.
* A version 1.0.0 will be published.
* If there is a major change to the discord api that renders the bot non-functional, I will supply fixes until Jan 1, 2026 
* If you have any questions please contact me at the same email used to report bugs.
